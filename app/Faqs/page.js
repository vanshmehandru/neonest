        question: "What foods should I avoid giving my baby?",

        question: "When will my baby sleep through the night?",
        answer:
          "Most babies can sleep through the night (6-8 hours) by 3-6 months, but this varies. Some may take longer, and that's completely normal.",

        question: "Is it safe for my baby to sleep on their stomach?",

      },
      {
        question: "When do babies typically say their first words?",
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: "How often should my baby have checkups?",
        answer:
