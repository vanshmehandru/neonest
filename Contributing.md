### 🧑‍💻 Code Contributions (Pull Requests)

Here’s a quick overview of the contribution flow:

#### 🔁 Contribution Workflow

1. **Star** and **Fork** the repo.

2. Clone your fork:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/AditiGupta-tech/NeoNest.git
 ```

3. **Create a new branch:**
 ```bash
 git checkout -b yourname/feature-name
 ```

4. **Make your changes:**
 * Stick to the project structure.

5. **Format your code:**
 ```bash
 npm run lint
 ```

## 🧠 Code Style Guidelines

To ensure consistency and maintainability, please adhere to these guidelines:

* Use **camelCase** for variables and function names.
* Component files should be **PascalCase**: `SleepTracker.jsx`.
* Run `npm run lint` to follow our ESLint + Prettier rules.
* Keep functions modular and reusable.
* Use descriptive variable names (`sleepDuration` > `temp123`).
* Avoid hardcoded values – use constants/configs where possible.

---

## 📁 File Naming Conventions

* **🧩 React Components:** PascalCase (`BabyStats.jsx`)
* **📂 Folders:** kebab-case (`/baby-data`, `/user-profile`)
* **🖼 Images/GIFs:** kebab-case and descriptive (`baby-growth-graph.gif`)
* **📄 Markdown/Docs:** kebab-case (`getting-started.md`, `api-reference.md`)

## ✅ PR Review Process

We aim to keep things smooth and transparent:

* Once your PR is submitted, a maintainer will review it.
* You may be asked to:
 * Fix styling issues.
 * Add missing documentation/tests.
 * Break large PRs into smaller pieces.
* After approval:
 * Your PR will be merged with a squash merge to keep history clean.
 * Points will be awarded if part of GSSoC.
 * You’ll receive feedback, even if the PR isn’t merged immediately.
* ⌛ Reviews may take **24–72 hours** depending on activity. Thanks for your patience!
